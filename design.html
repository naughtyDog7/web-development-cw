            <p class="section-general-text">The designers at Mercedes-BFake are reconciling tradition and modernity in designing the cars for the future. Their work centres on “Sensual Purity” as an expression of modern luxury. The new design idiom featuring reduced edges and creases – indentations and recesses in the sheet metal – aims to create clear forms and sensual surfaces which showcase high tech while also arousing emotions. Design creates something out of the ordinary and makes a major contribution to shaping the brand image. For Mercedes-BFake designers, good design has to be both beautiful and intelligent.</p>
